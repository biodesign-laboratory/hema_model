This is an algorithm to run reachability analysis on a hybrid system. The general premise is that you have a list of queues,
each a vector (X, m, t) where X is the set of states at time t and m is the mode the set is being propogated under. X is 
currently just a LazySets.Interval data type. When X intersects with the guard, the part that intersects with the guard goes
into a new queue at the time t that it intersects and it switches to the other mode m. The part that doesn't intersect
is also put into a queue at that time t, but with the mode m it had been running at. These two queues are then added to the
list of queues (i.e. the major_queue). The process then restarts, running each of these queues one after the other, until 
the time T has been reached for all of them.
